ADD SENSORS:
* Soil Temperature (?)
* Water EC
* Weight



  - EEPROM wear & scalability: every boot writes a log entry (createBootLogEntry() main/main.ino:258) and
    writeLogEntry() writes the entire slot byte‑by‑byte (main/logs.cpp:107+). Boot also scans all slots twice
    (initLogs→goToLatestSlot main/logs.cpp:270+, and initialaverageMsBetweenFeeds() main/main.ino:298+). This is linear
    in log size and will get slow with a larger EEPROM. Best practice: store head pointers/averages in metadata with a
    small checksum, update incrementally, and avoid unconditional boot logs.
  - Wear considerations: boot log and frequent full‑slot EEPROM updates don’t throttle writes. On AVRs with limited
    write endurance, best practice is to minimize writes (only when values change materially, or buffer and batch).
  


  - Sensor init default value: async moisture seed returns 0 until warmup completes (initMoistureSensor main/
    moistureSensor.cpp:86+). The UI shows 0% briefly, which can mislead. Best practice: gate display until seeded or
    show “—/NA”.
  - No integrity/CRC on stored logs/config: log metadata lacks checksum/versioning beyond a single byte
    (LOG_FORMAT_VERSION only). Corruption isn’t detected; reads just proceed. Best practice: checksum or versioned
    headers per record or per metadata block.
  - Screensaver redraw inefficiency: screensaver path clears and redraws the LCD every loop iteration (displayInfo main/
    main.ino:609+). That hammers I2C for no benefit and can slow wake. Prefer a timed update or only move the cursor
    without full lcd.clear() each tick.
